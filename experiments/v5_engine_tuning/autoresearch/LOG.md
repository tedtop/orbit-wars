# Autoresearch Log — ratchet history

Append-only. Each experiment: hypothesis → gauntlet result → KEEP/DISCARD. The champion is the best KEEP.

| date | experiment (bot) | hypothesis | gauntlet result | verdict |
|------|------------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| 2026-06-15 | precog/kingmaker/maestro/helmsman/oracle | bolt-on heuristics beat the engine | all ≈parity (seat-swapped) | ❌ discard (archived) |
| 2026-06-16 | comet_reaper_tuned (Optuna, ~19 knobs) | config tuning beats the engine | best 0.34 | ❌ discard (base config is a tight optimum) |
| 2026-06-17 | **schmeekler** | capture static (non-rotating) planets first | **72% 2P vs comet_reaper; beats whole panel (producer-v2 77%); best-in-pod 4P** | ✅ **KEEP → champion, submitted** |
| 2026-06-17 | comet_reaper_search | forward-sim rollout re-rank (λ-blend) | no signal — rollout policy reproduces the candidate moves | ❌ discard (needs a real MCTS tree + value fn) |

**Current champion:** `schmeekler` (static_target_bonus=1.5).
**Next (per program.md queue):** more structural scoring features (potential-field/future-positions,
interdiction, phase-aware sizing) combined with schmeekler; then proper MCTS as the moonshot.
